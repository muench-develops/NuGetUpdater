## üõ†Ô∏è Requirements
1. **.NET SDK**:
   - Ensure `.NET 6+` or `.NET 9+` is installed to run this tool.
2. **MSBuild**:
   - MSBuild must be installed and added to your system's PATH environment variable. 
   - Example path for Visual Studio 2022:
     ```
     C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\2022\Community\MSBuild\Current\Bin
     ```
3. **NuGet Feed**:
   - The tool uses NuGet's public feed by default. Update the `appsettings.json` file if you need to use a custom feed.

## üì¶ Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/NuGetUpdater.git
   cd NuGetUpdater
    ```

2. Build the project:

   ```bash
   dotnet build
    ```

3. Run the application:
   ```bash
   dotnet run --path "path/to/your/project.csproj" --major --log "path/to/logfile.log"
    ```

4. Publish the application 
To prepare the application for use, publish it as a standalone executable:

   ```bash
    dotnet publish -c Release -r win-x64 --self-contained true -o [TargetFolder]
    ```

- Replace [TargetFolder] with the directory where youd like the published files to be saved. For example, `C:\Tools\NuGetUpdater`.
- The `--self-contained true` flag ensures the executable includes the .NET runtime, so it can run on systems without .NET installed.

Once published, navigate to the [TargetFolder] to run the application or configure it for global use.

 ## üñ•Ô∏è Usage
 ### Basic Commands
```bash
NuGetUpdater --path "path/to/your/project.csproj" --major
```

- `--path`: Path to the .csproj or .sln file.
- `--major`: | --minor | --patch: Specify the type of updates to apply.
- `--log`: (Optional) Specify a file path to save logs.

## Examples
1. Update to the latest minor versions:
```bash
NuGetUpdater --path "path/to/your/project.csproj" --minor
```
2. Update all projects in a solution:
```bash
NuGetUpdater --path "path/to/your/solution.sln" --patch --log "nuget-updater.log"
```
